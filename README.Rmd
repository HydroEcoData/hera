WORK IN PROGRESS

Hera is a prototype package to explore the future of regulatory environmental
modelling. The package outlines possible approaches to creating a shared
research platform for building, testing and deploying models used to assess
environmental risk for regulatory purposes.

See [Request for comment](https://ecodata1.github.io/hera/articles/hera_specifications.html) paper for an outline and broad technical
specifications.

Hera is envisaged as an opinionated collections of R packages designed for sharing
environmental models. All packages share an underlying design, grammar and data
structures. This allows the separation of the concerns between data, models,
post-modelling steps and visualisation. Allowing greater collaboration and
sharing of methods and tools.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ecodata1/hera")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

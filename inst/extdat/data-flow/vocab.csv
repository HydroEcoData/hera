Impact,12/10/2022,The degree by which circumstances have deviated from normal,Something can have an impact without causing environmental harm. E.g. silt pollution in a river might upset people seeing it without doing ecological damage. This could be considered as consequences of an incident meeting a receptor.,A consequence of an incident that has the potential to lead to societal or environmental effects,"Or from base classification or some other baseline state.  Impact definition and field does not work for flooding -  impacts would be no. properties flooded, impact on human health, road closed etc.  The event severity would be based on a cumulative assessments of impacts.  There will be multiple impacts for a flood event and we will not get direct observations of all of them.

SF: There can be a hierarchy of terms, and we cn add in specific terms that apply to flooding, but we need to define what we mean when we say impact, and then decide whether we can even have one term that can be used for both flooding and regulatory events. Because ""impact"" is currently used for both.",,"E.g. for assessing whether to deploy, classification, reports to PF.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

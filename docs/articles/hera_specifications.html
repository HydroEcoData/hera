<p>In the beginning, aquatic ecological modelling was a novelty. In the 1980’s really only rivpacs was widely used. In the 1990’s more ecology elements joined the nascent modelling community with phytobenthos and macrophytes. In this period, there were one or two unsuccessful attempts to create a joined up system, encompassing multiple aspects of the aquatic ecosystem (SERCON?). Finally, with the WFD in the 2000’s a patchwork approach was used allowing each biological element to create their own tool, the outputs from each tools were feed into the overall classification result. Agencies used a number of different approaches internally to for aggregating of results as well as processing and compiling raw data from databases or other sources.</p>
<p>The outputs from these tools are inter-calibrated but the implementation details for each modelling tool was left to BQE group. Running and pulling together all this data was difficult. Equally, running these tools for investigative or scenario planning (rather than WFD classification) was also difficult. Ultimately, WFD tools delivered a good idea of where problems were but less detail on the nature of the pressure or options to fix it.</p>

<div id="dream" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#dream" class="anchor"></a>2025 Dream</h2>
<p>The ease and access to modelling tools now means there is a proliferation of modelling tools, indices and metrics to choose from. We have seen many useful results from modelling techniques in weather forecasting, flood planning and climate change research. In the next 10 years, it is likely that aquatic ecological models will be subsumed into a more large scale environmental and climate models. These ‘total environment’ models may for instance use climate change models to forecast impact on invertebrates, water-use models the impact on fish, flooding models the impact on macrophytes. These large scale environmental models will integrate elements of existing invertebrate, fish and macrophytes models and reference data into large hybrid models also incorporating rainfall, flow and climate predictions. The outputs from which we be used across disciplines to plan flood management, biodiversity improvements, carbon sequestering. Allowing the impact and trade offs of each planning scenario on multiple disciplines allowing informed discussion on the best decisions.</p>
<p>The idea of running a single model, with a single dataset to produce a single output will seem antiquated. All ecology data will be freely accessible and bundled together (along with chemistry, climate, meteorological, geological etc) and multiple models run across the same data, providing outputs on many aspects of ecology, chemistry, climate, flooding, biodiversity etc.</p>
<p>As soon as an ecologist uploads fish counter data, plant DNA or aerial imagery, this data is ingested into the ‘lake’ of environmental data. A huge number of models and predictions automatically run based on this new data providing fresh insights in environmental harms, biodiversity trends, costs and impacts. Weekly, Monthly, Yearly…summary reports drafted (with a fair bit of automation) are produced where the new findings, improvements, harms, opportunities can be discussed and addressed.</p>
<p>These reports will help us effectively direct resources to targeting environment risks and tracking pressures. But more than identifying environment harm, these models outputs provide options and scenarios for us to explore how to best plan for the future and what different potential scenarios look like.</p>

<div id="the-problem" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-problem" class="anchor"></a>The problem</h2>
<p>Currently there are a large number of modelling and classification tools available for understanding and responding to environmental harm in aquatic systems. They do not share common input or output formats see <a href="#appendix">appendix</a> for examples. Making integration and holistic understanding of the environment challenging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools use different data structures and formats for input and outputs.</li>
<li>There is no single repository of ‘reference’ sites and results.</li>
<li>There is no single repository for predictive variables (slope, discharge, geology, alkalinity etc).</li>
<li>There is no single taxonomic reference table or standard.</li>
<li>Confidence and uncertainty in results are calculated and presented in different ways.</li>
<li>All tools/models are development in isolation.</li>
<li>There is limited use in scenario planning (for instance how landuse changes or new discharges could affect the ecology).</li>
<li>There is limited use in climate change or environmental forecasting.</li>
<li>Best practice and associated tools for auditing and quality control are not shared across methods.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="joint-research-platform" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#joint-research-platform" class="anchor"></a>Joint research platform</h2>
<p>To aid collaboration and to response to the changing environmentally pressures, we propose creating a joint research platform to share understanding on the environment while providing the software infrastructure to lighten the burden of more mundane tasks involved in maintaining and deploying new models and interfaces.</p>
<p>This is influenced by the work of climate change research and weather forecasting communities. As well as larger science projects such as CERN. And smaller scale example such as ropenSci.</p>

<p>Most regulatory modelling work is development under the UKTAG group. This group has a number of sub-groups for freshwater, marine etc. This organisation has worked well and is active. The UKTAG group and it’s nominated leads in the devolved agencies would continue to develop methods and tools. However, these tools would be incorporated into a joint platform for delivery. Where tools are agency specific, these could also make use of the platform.</p>
<p>Currently some models for environmental are shared on github e.g. darleq3, fsc2, rict. They are published in different areas and have different access controls. The proposal would seek to share these tools under a single repo once the tool is finalised.</p>
<p>As agencies commission new tools to be developed, researchers can upload their predictive variables, reference data and models into a central repo for easier collaboration.</p>

<a href="#lots-of-datasets---one-underlying-data-structure" class="anchor"></a>Lots of datasets - one underlying data structure?</h2>
<p>Ecological modelling relies on sampling. The samples come in a range of forms from points, transects, images, grabs, DNA etc. But the general feature of modelling is based on being able to predict what we expect to find from whatever sampling technique we deploy. The sample is the fundamental observation which we compare against our prediction. The samples are discreet and independent, either observed instantaneously or perhaps over a few minutes or hours (where dynamic changes are not significant).</p>
<p>Multiple samples can be aggregated to smooth variance but the sample still remains the fundamental building block. The sample could be a single pixel from an aerial image or a salmon moving through a fish counter. We still make predictions of what we expect this sample to be like even if the true picture only emerges after several samples are aggregated or compared.</p>

<p>Below is an example of diatom records, invert data and river flow in a shared input format.</p>
<p>They share some reference/book keeping variables but not all. Ultimately, only one reference is needed which is a unique sample id. The other reference variables can be ‘nested’ or in others words there can be as many or a few as you like. These nested values could be sample type, collector, instrument details etc. Or variables later used for aggregation such as water body, river, geographic area etc. For example:</p>

<p>The observation comes in two parts, the unique name/id for what you are observing and the value associated with it. For clarity these variables are called ‘question’ and ‘response’. The question could be “Taxon name?” and the response “Brown Trout”. However, the question must be unique. As ‘Taxon name?’ will be different depending on what survey is being undertaken. So question_id and response_id are given to allow these to be unique with metadata to provide a more readable format.</p>
<p>UUID are used to provide unique IDs for this variables.</p>

<a href="#model-platform" class="anchor"></a>Model platform</h2>
<p>There is no prescribed modelling program or software. Researchers can download the data provided and use any software they desire - as long as it has an api.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if researchers can’t provide an api for others. The recommendation is to use R - which integrates more directly into Hera.</p>
<p>Once modelling is completed, the model object is saved and deployed. Any existing or future data collected using the platform will be run through the model at the sample level.</p>
<p>Researchers can then build tools to display and aggregate the sample level results as required. Where it would be possible to share techniques for producing Confidence of Class, assessment of data suitablility and adjustment factors etc.</p>

<div id="hera" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#hera" class="anchor"></a>Hera</h2>
<p>Here we introduce a prototype package called Hera. Hera provides a framework for taking in ecological data, detecting what type of data has been entered, running the relevant models and returning a classification. The examples below are based on ‘fake’ data, indices and classification methods and is just ‘dream code’ at the moment.</p>
<p>This demo dataset contains information on diatoms, fish and inverts:</p>
<pre><code>library(hera)
str(demo_data)
</code></pre>
<p>We run this dataset through Hera providing a prediction for each taxa in each sample:</p>
<pre><code>
predictions &lt;- hera_predict(demo_data)
head(predictions)
</code></pre>
<p>Based on an associated score for each taxa, we predict indices for each sample:</p>
<pre><code>
indices &lt;- hera_indices(demo_data)
head(indices)
</code></pre>
<p>Based on the predicted and observed indices - we classify each sample:</p>
<pre><code>
class &lt;- hera_classify(demo_data)
head(class)
</code></pre>
<p>We now aggregated the samples by season, year or multi-year as required:</p>
<pre><code>
aggregate &lt;- hera_aggregate(demo_data)
head(class)
</code></pre>
<p>We now run a report assesses samples from the same location for consistency. Note, that no report for fish is produced, the necessary adjustment/intreptation parameters have not been created for fish. This demostrates that it is step by step process. Not all tools/models will have all the features development if not required or if not prioritized:</p>
<pre><code>compare_report &lt;- compare(demo_data)
compare_report
</code></pre>
<p>We now run a report assesses two samples assess a discharge (up and downstream):</p>
<pre><code>compare_report &lt;- compare(demo_data)
compare_report
</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="sharing" class="section level2">

<a href="#sharing" class="anchor"></a>Sharing</h2>
<p>Hera allows multiple ecological elements to be assessed through the same interface. But not just the interface is shared. Other areas of the infrastructure are shared including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reporting and comparison tools can also be shared between multiple elements.</li>
<li>Validation checks and other universally required mechanisms are shared and easily configurable for new models/methods.</li>
<li>Testing infrastructure.</li>
<li>Confidence of class and data suitability algorithms.</li>
